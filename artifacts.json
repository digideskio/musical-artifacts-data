    "description": "  AVL Drumkits are a free GPL collection of sampled drum sound libraries in various formats recorded from two 'working' acoustic drumkits for music creation with MIDI sequencers or DAWs. The kits feature 5 velocity layers from each kit piece and also multiple instances of various kit pieces (ie tom center, tom edge). The samples were carefully recorded with a blend of large diaphragm condenser and dynamic microphones and each sample has been precisely edited. As someone creating music in a home studio environment I found that some of the expensive commercial drum solutions sounded overly produced and out of place and also took gigabytes of hard drive space to install in addition to requiring huge amounts of precious system RAM simply to work. The intention of AVL Drumkits is to first offer high-quality realistic 'drumkit-in-the room' sounds and to secondly be very efficient with system resources and suitable for use on computers both new and old. \r\n\r\n## The Kits\r\n \r\n\r\n### The Black Pearl:\r\n\r\n![](http://www.bandshed.net/avldrumkits/images/BlackPearl-300px.png) \r\n\r\n  Pearl DX Professional Series\r\n 22x20\" Kick\r\n 16x16\" Floor Tom, 12x9\",13x10\" Toms\r\n 14x7\" DX Pro Pearl Snare with 2-ply Evans batter head\r\n *Alt and 5pc. kits have 1-ply Remo Ambassador batter head\r\n 14\" Sabian AA Rock Hats\r\n 10\" Zildjian A Splash\r\n 16\" Sabian AA Medium Thin Crash\r\n 17\" Sabian AAXplosion Crash\r\n 20\" Sabian AAXplosion Ride\r\n + more...

Furthermore the output of a Alesis DM5 drummodule were stored set up with the “Speed Metal” sample. The trigger module were activated using the Axis E-Kit trigger system.\r\n * The hihat and ride cymbal were close-mic recorded using cardioid condenser microphones.\r\n * The crash cymbals were recorded using RØDE NT5 over head microphones.\r\n * The ambiance of the entire kit were recorded using cardioid condenser microphones.\r\n\r\nEach of the microphones are mapped to an output channel when the plugin is assigned to the midi track. The tracks are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Overhead left (RØDE-NT5)\r\n    Overhead right (RØDE-NT5)\r\n    Snare top (Shure SM57)\r\n    Snare bottom (Shure SM57)\r\n    Snare trigger (DDrum)\r\n    Alesis DM5\r\n    Kick right (AKG D112)\r\n    Kick left (AKG D112)\r\n    Hihat (Cardioid condenser)\r\n    Rise cymbal (Cardioid condenser)\r\n    Tom 1 (AKG C518M)\r\n    Tom 2 (AKG C518M)\r\n    Tom 3 (AKG C518M)\r\n    Tom 4 / floor tom (AKG C518M)\r\n    Ambience left (Cardioid condenser)\r\n    Ambience right (Cardioid condenser)\r\n\r\n",

This can be used with software amplifiers such as the free fender and marshall vst plugins on [this forum](http://www.guitarampmodeling.com/) (there are lots of software guitar amplifier and pedal related things worth downloading on the Guitar Amp Modelling forum) or amplifier impulse response files with your convolution reverbs like Jconv on Linux or Freeverb on Windows.\r\n\r\nThis giga sample also has presets that are through a Fender reverb unit. The reverb unit is designed to go before the amplifier so it is well suited to a direct in recording that is later going to be processed (i.e. put through a software amplifier). You also have a choice of how much reverb you use just by using the mod wheel 2 (cc13) on certain presets. Mod wheel 1 (cc1) is the release. This is so that you can easily set the length of the notes as long as you need.\r\n\r\nOther presets include a fake twelve string (octave harmonies on each key), low pass filtered, split voices of muted fifths at one end and solo guitar at the other end of the keyboard (for quickly creating tunes and ideas) and all sorts of different combinations of presets to cover most options. The only two controllers you need for any of the presets are mod wheel 1 (cc1) and mod wheel 2 (cc13). The functions of these controllers are always part of the preset name.",

The J-Station samples make a distorted beefy bass sound which can be useful for some music i.e. 3 piece bands where tha bass fills out instead of a rhythm guitar or just for a more lo-fi bass sound. The direct samples are not so distorted and can be used in alot more styles of music. You can use a mix of the direct and J-Station samples to get the balance of dirt just right on one of the presets (using mod wheel 2 or cc13).\r\n\r\nThere is a preset that includes slaps and slides etc to help add some realism.",

    "description": "The single keys at the beginning of the keyboard (C2-C3 white notes only) contain a variety of percussion instruments (2 wood blocks, an Irish bongo, a mini rain stick, a mini swinging drum, a tambourine, a mini hollow wood log and a mini wooden scraper). Then the black keys further up are groups of instruments that cut each other off. For instance the first group of black notes (F#3,G#3,A#3) are all samples from the big conga but with different hit types. The next 2 black notes are a dear skin bongo. The next 3 black notes are the little conga. The next 2 black notes are a little metal bongo. The next 3 black notes are the medium conga and the next 2 black notes are a home made plastic shaker. This makes it easy to know the grouped instruments. It is also easy to whack a way at the congas (like real congas) as they are all the black keys in groups of 3 and each conga cuts its own keys off if another is played. I mainly recorded this for the 3 congas and then added the other bits as I had them laying around (some are even from my childrens musical instruments bag, i.e. wood blocks from the early learning centre and a home made plastic shaker). The congas are boomy when played hard but with a lot more delicate hand sound when played softly. It is possible to get a variety of sounds and styles with these conga samples.",

    "description": "This is a Japanese Fender Jaguar electric guitar played on the both pick-ups setting and is played through a Fender Bassman '59 Reissue with old valves in. This amp gives a really nice full clean sound. I have recorded it on the edge of break up so the low velocity samples come out clean and the high velocity samples come out with a bit of nataural power valve distortion. You can add more distortion with effects if you need it dirtier. It is hard to get this natural break up sound with effects which is why I have recorded it that way and if you add distortion it still has the natural bite of a valve amp (except with more distortion). This makes it very expressive just by the difference in tones at different played velocities. The lowest velocity is muted samples. Presets include split keyboard of muted 5ths at one end and solo guitar at the other end (good for jamming out tunes), muted samples preset, a fake 12-string (octave harmonies on each key), slaps and slides etc and a standard mapping. The sound is suited to a lot of types of music. These guitars have been used for all sorts of music over the years. It has not much sustain and makes a bright clean sound.",

    "description": "Here is a sound bank of a small diatonic accordion, with 21 keys on two rows at the right hand, and 8 basses at the left, and a second stop that sounds lower. A diatonic accordion does not produce the same notes when you push or pull the bellows, and this makes this instrument not so easy to play... More, it has not all the semi-tones of its 3 octaves (from D2 to E5). With this sound bank, you can forget those drawbacks, because we have \"interpolated\" the missing notes, and all the notes are played in a same manner on a keyboard...\r\nThis sound bank is available here in soundfont and kontakt2 formats.\r\n\r\nIn order to use a sound bank of a diatonic accordion correctly, you must know that the left keys are used to play accompaniment, and allow to alternate basses and chords, as you can hear it in a waltz. This instrument has 6 basses (C, D, E, F, G, A) and 6 chords (C major, D major, E major, F major, G major and A minor). In order to play them easily at the same time than the melody, we put them on the two first octaves of a piano, C-A0 for basses, and C-A1 for chords. So you can alternate basses and chords balancing fingers from an octave to the other. It requires a big keyboard with 88 keys, like a piano, or two smaller keyboards with at least 55 keys... To make it easier to use, left keys and right keys of this accordion are separate in different presets.\r\n\r\nYou must also know that, on the real instrument, the left keys can be played with the first or the second stop simultaneaously, but it is impossible to play the two stops together. It would be useless, anyway, because the reeds used by the second stop are the same as the ones used by the first. The second stop adds a lower sounding reed to the first stop. Please consider this if you want to use this sound bank in a realistic way.\r\n",

If you are a user of Hauptwerk format, go to [Soni Musicae / Hauptwerk](http://duphly.free.fr/en/index.html). \r\n\r\nAt first, we did not want to distribute it, because this is not an extraordinary organ, and it was impossible to avoid a big noise of organ-blower during the recording : as it is a house organ, it stood in a flat, and the microphones could not stand far from it. But, finally, after some numerical treatments, we think that the result is not so bad, and we give it to you as close as possible to the real thing, without changing many of its defaults...\r\n\r\nThere is no natural reverb in the rather small room where it stood, and the sound is dry and a bit agressive, specially in the high notes, because it is the sound of the original instrument, and it is also the result of the numerical treatments that remove the noise of the organ-blower.\r\n\r\nThe organ is tuned to A 440 Hz and to equal temperament.\r\n\r\nTo make this organ easy to use, this sf2 soundbank comes with many presets that respect the usual relevant combinations of the original instrument. You will find :\r\n\r\n    01 - bourdon 8'\r\n    02 - flute 4'\r\n    03 - octave 2'\r\n    04 - chimney flute 8'\r\n    05 - flute 2'\r\n    06 - bourdon 8' + flute 4'\r\n    07 - bourdon 8' + flute 4' + octave 2'\r\n    08 - bourdon 8' + chimney flute 8'\r\n    09 - chimney flute 8' + flute 4'\r\n    10 - chimney flute 8' + flute 4' + octave 2'\r\n    11 - chimney flute 8' + octave 2'\r\n    12 - chimney flute 8' + flute 2'\r\n    13 - chimney flute 8' + flute 4' + flute 2'\r\n    14 - bourdon 8' + flute 4' + flute 2'\r\n    15 - bourdon 8' + chimney flute 8' + flute 4'\r\n    16 - bourdon 8' + chimney flute 8' + flute 4' + Flute 2'\r\n    17 - bourdon 8' + chimney flute 8' + octave 2'\r\n    18 - bourdon 8' + chimney flute 8' + flute 4' + octave 2'\r\n    19 - bourdon 8' + flute 2'\r\n    20 - bourdon 8' + octave 2'\r\n    21 - flute 4' + flute 2'\r\n    22 - Tutti\r\n\r\nIn the Kontakt 2 version, there are not all those combinations, because you can do your own as you like...",

So you can play it in your compositions without problem.",

This soundbank is available in soundfont, and Kontakt 2 format. If you want a version for Hauptwerk, go to [Soni Musicae / Hauptwerk](http://duphly.free.fr/en/index.html). The soundfont version is not complete, because it has not the sound of mechanics (that are in original samples) when the musician releases the keys of the harpsichord, but the one for Kontakt has it.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard of a harpsichord is not touch sensitive (dynamic), and sounds at the same level whatever you press the keys, but it seems that it is impossible to obtain this with the soundfont format... To avoid dynamic differences and respect the original instrument, you can adjust velocity in your sequencer in a way that the volume is constantly the highest... The Kontakt 2 version does not need this. ",

The equalised Mk II Violins\r\n5. About the Mellotron sounds\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1. Licence\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe Mellotron samples in this Giga file were made by taijiguy, a.k.a. Bernie Kornowicz, and are his copyright. You are free to use the samples in any way you like, except to package them for commercial purposes. This licence gives you the right to use these samples, together or separately, in any creative musical work whatever, free or commercial. These musical works may be distributed in any way, without any attribution whatever. You MAY NOT sell the samples or the Giga file and you may not repackage the samples in a different format and sell that.\r\n\r\nThis Giga file are made by Quirq with Bernie's express permission and is copyright Quirq. You may freely distribute this Giga file, provided that it is distributed with this README file and provided that it is not distributed commercially.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. Giga format\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nWith the permission of Bernie, the samples were compiled into Giga format by Quirq in December 2010, using Gigedit, part of the LinuxSampler project (www.linuxsampler.org). Bernie had one note per sample, so no pitchshifting was necessary and the natural range of a Mellotron has been retained.\r\n\r\nTo retain the essence of the Mellotron, the samples are unlooped and not velocity sensitive in any way. A low pass filter is mapped to the modwheel to emulate the tone control on a real Mellotron. No other unnatural effects or tweaking are used, except as mentioned below for the \"M400\" sounds.\r\n\r\nThe large Giga file is keyswitched so that you can change sounds in real time -- as you could on a real Mellotron -- that is, without having to load another Giga file. The keyswitching runs from C0 to C1 (a fifth below the bottom note on a Tron). The switching works as follows:\r\n\r\n    C0  M400 Violins\r\n    C#0 M400 Violins Yes EQ\r\n    D0  M400 Violins Smooth Ryder EQ\r\n    D#0 Cello\r\n    E0  String Section\r\n    F0  Mk II Violins\r\n    F#0 M300A (violins)\r\n    G0  M300B (solo violin)\r\n    G#0 Mk II Brass\r\n    A0  GC3 Brass\r\n    A#0 Mk II Flute\r\n    B0  Woodwind2\r\n    C1  Combined Choir\r\n\r\n### 3. About the samples\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe samples contained in this Giga file were recorded by Bernie Kornowicz, a.k.a. taijiguy on the KVR Audio forums, and can be found on his website http://leisureland.us/audio/MellotronSamples/MellotronSamples.htm.\r\n\r\nFrom the site:\r\n\"The 3 Violins and Combined Brass were sampled in 2003 from a 1973 Mellotron M400S. The String Section, Combined Choir, GC3 Brass, M300A, M300B and Woodwind 2 were sampled in 2008. The Mk II Flute and Cello were sampled in 2010... The samples were recorded \"hot\" with the tone control fully clockwise. This is not how M400's are normally played. The tone control is generally set from about 1/8 to 1/3 clockwise, assuming the amplification system tones are flat.\r\n\r\n\"These samples have not been looped so as to retain the need to use the spider technique of playing a real Mellotron. If you want to loop them, that's your choice. They are approximately 7 seconds in length and retain both the initial attack, and in many cases, the bad endings.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mk II Violins and Mk II Brass samples are also hosted by Real Media Music at http://realmusicmedia.net/Mellotron.html.\r\n\r\nThe information on that site states that the Tron is a M400S, serial number 500, whose restoration was completed on 28th August 2005. At the time the Three Violins and Combined Brass were sampled \"The Tron's condition was decent. The heads were cleaned and the azimuth was aligned by Streetly Electronics in England (the original maker of the Tron) just prior to sampling. The capstan was clean, but the pinch rollers were a little dry. The cabinet was out of square. The tapes and frame were brand new.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### 4. The equalised Mk II Strings\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nConventional wisdom has it that the famous Three Violins sound from the M400 Mellotron was just the previous Mk II Violins sound that had been highpass filtered. Ryder Duncan, a.k.a. Squonk on YouTube, does not think that this is the case and, after extensive experimentation, has arrived at EQ settings which he feels come much closer to turning the Mk II Violins into the M400 Three Violins/Violins sound. Details can be found at http://ryderduncan.com/themusicalbox/?p=33. \r\n\r\nSquonk's videos on YouTube are also well worth checking out if you are a Tron fanatic.\r\n\r\nThe Mk II Violins samples were processed using these EQ settings to create the three pseudo-M400 sounds: \"M400 Violins\" for the generic EQ settings, \"M400 Violins Yes EQ\" for a softer, more Yes-like sound and \"M400 Violins Smooth Ryder EQ\" is Ryder Duncan's own personal EQ settings for a smooth sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 5. About the Mellotron sounds\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease see the section above regarding the M400 Violins sound and its relationship to the original Mk II Violins. The M400 was the most portable and cheapest incarnation of the Mellotron and was introduced in 1970. After this time, I would expect most, if not all, bands touring with Mellotrons would have used the M400. No doubt many studios still retained Mk IIs, but the smoother, softer, more luscious M400 Violins sound is what one usually associates with music made after this time, such as by the likes of The Strawbs, Genesis, Yes, Red-era King Crimson and countless other great progressive rock bands of the 1970s and beyond. The M400's predecessor, the rare M300, had all new soundsets recorded for it, in two banks labelled A and B. These sounds were apparently favoured by the late \"Woolly\" Wolstenholme of Barclay James Harvest: the M300 was popular with BJH, Gentle Giant and others. The Mk II was a huge, two manual beast released in 1964, so music such as \"Nights In White Satin\" and other classics by the The Moody Blues and early King Crimson would have featured the much more strident, almost grating sound of the Mk II Violins (which is what the modwheel/\"tone control\" is there for!). The Mk II and M400 Violins are three instruments together, hence also being commonly called the Three Violins sound. The M300A strings sound was two violins playing together, whereas the M300B sound is a solo violin.\r\n\r\nThe 'cello sounds were recorded by a session musician called Reginald Kirby. According to many sources (possibly all repeating each other), Reg played on a number of recordings by The Beatles \"including Eleanor Rigby\", although other sources give a different name for the cellist on that piece. Anyway, Reg refused to re-tune his 'cello for the Mellotron recording session, so the bottom five notes of the Mellotron Cello are actually double bass, which is why they sound so dramatically different.\r\n\r\nThe Mk II Brass, or Mk II Combined Brass as it is also known, is a mixture of two saxophones, a trombone and two trumpets. The GC3 Brass was created for a Scottish jazz trombonist called George Chisholm and is three recordings of individual trombone notes mixed together.\r\n\r\nThe Combined Choir is a mixture of the Boys Choir, Male Choir and Female Choir sounds and is not to be confused with the famous 8 Choir, which consists of four male and four female singers.\r\n\r\nThe Woodwind2 apparently includes a French horn and a piccolo. In addition to what exactly, I don't know...\r\n\r\nv1.0 [03/02/11]\r\n\r\n### About the Demo\r\n\r\nThe demo plays through each of the sounds in turn: \"M400 Violins\", \"M400 Violins Yes EQ\", \"M400 Violins Smooth Ryder EQ\", Cello, followed by demonstration of the five double-bass notes on the Cello sound, String Section, Mk II Strings, M300A (violins), M300B (solo violin), Mk II Brass, GC3 Brass, Mk II Flute, Woodwind2, Combined Choir.\r\n\r\nThere then follows a demonstration of the low-pass filter, which is swept using the modwheel, using the \"M400 Violins\" sound. Notice the tapes running out: the Mellotron's seven or eight second note length is preserved as the samples are not looped. The filter is manipulated again briefly to find a nice setting, before playing a pad part using the \"M400 Violins\". The final part of the demo uses a short motif played with the filter fully open again, first on the \"M400 Violins\", then String Orchestra, M300A (violins), M300B (solo violin), Mk II Brass, GC3 Brass, Flute, Woodwind2 and finally Combined Choir. No processing of any kind was used, except Linuxsampler's in-built low-pass filter, where noted above.",
